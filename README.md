This project works as a mini-twitter. Here users can leave inspiring posts for others to see and interact with. The database were made using MongoDB and REST Api created for CRUD operations - Created endpoints for GET and for POST.

I pushed the database to Heroku - The Frontend was pushed to Netlify.
